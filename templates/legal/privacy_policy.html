            <h3 class="h5 mt-4">3.1 Encryption</h3>
            <p><strong>Your journal entries are encrypted at rest.</strong> We use industry-standard Fernet encryption (AES-128 in CBC mode) to encrypt all journal entry titles and content before storing them in our database.</p>
            <p>This means:</p>

                <li>Database backups are encrypted</li>
                <li>Database administrators cannot read your private thoughts</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Multi-factor authentication for internal systems</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">4. Data Sharing & Third Parties</h2>

            <h3 class="h5 mt-4">4.1 We DO NOT Sell Your Data</h3>
            <p class="fw-bold text-success">We will never sell, rent, or trade your personal information or journal entries to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 mt-4">4.2 Service Providers We Use</h3>
            <p>We share limited data with trusted third-party services:</p>
            <ul>

            <h3 class="h5 mt-4">4.3 POV (Point of View) Sharing with Friends</h3>
            <p>Reflekt includes a feature that allows you to share specific portions of your journal entries with friends using POV blocks:</p>

            <p><strong>How POV Sharing Works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Selective Sharing</strong> - You can share specific paragraphs or thoughts from your entries, not entire entries</li>
                <li><strong>Friends Only</strong> - POV blocks can only be shared with users you've added as friends on Reflekt</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Injection</strong> - When you share a POV, the content is automatically added to your friend's journal entry for that date</li>
                <li><strong>Clear Attribution</strong> - Shared POVs are clearly marked with your username so recipients know who wrote it</li>
                <li><strong>Recipient Control</strong> - Recipients can delete POV content from their journal at any time</li>
                <li><strong>Optional Replies</strong> - Recipients can reply to your shared POVs, creating threaded conversations</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications</strong> - Friends receive notifications when you share POVs with them</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What's Shared:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Only the specific POV content you mark for sharing (using {pov} tags)</li>
                <li>Your username (so friends know who shared it)</li>
                <li>The date of your entry</li>
                <li>Any replies to the shared POV</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What's NOT Shared:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The rest of your journal entry remains private</li>
                <li>Your other entries are never shared unless you explicitly create POV blocks in them</li>
                <li>Media attachments, mood data, and other metadata remain private</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-muted small"><em>Important: Once you share a POV, it becomes part of your friend's journal entry. While they can delete it, you cannot remotely remove it from their journal after sharing. Only share content you're comfortable with your friends keeping.</em></p>

            <h3 class="h5 mt-4">4.4 Family Plan Data Sharing</h3>
            <p><strong>Reflekt offers Family Plans that allow one subscriber to provide premium access to up to 5 family members.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Information Visible to Family Plan Administrators:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Family Member List</strong> - Administrators can see the names and email addresses of family members in their plan</li>
                <li><strong>Join Dates</strong> - When each member was added to the family plan</li>
                <li><strong>Membership Status</strong> - Whether invitations are pending or accepted</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Information NOT Visible to Family Plan Administrators:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Journal Entries</strong> - Family plan administrators CANNOT see family members' journal content</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Statistics</strong> - Activity, streaks, and other usage data remain private</li>
                <li><strong>Goals & Habits</strong> - Personal tracking data is never shared</li>
                <li><strong>Captures</strong> - Books, movies, places, and people tracked remain private</li>
                <li><strong>Friends List</strong> - Your friend connections remain private</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Automatic Friend Connection:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you join a family plan, you automatically become friends with the plan administrator</li>
                <li>This friendship connection follows the same privacy rules as all friendships</li>
                <li>Your journal entries remain private unless you explicitly share POV blocks</li>
                <li>You can unfriend the administrator, but you will remain in the family plan</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Family Plan Invitations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When administrators invite you, we send an email to your registered email address</li>
                <li>The invitation email contains information about who invited you and what accepting entails</li>
                <li>We share your email address with the person who invited you (only if you accept)</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="alert alert-info small">
                <strong>Privacy Guarantee:</strong> Being in a family plan does not grant the administrator any access to your journal content or personal data beyond what's listed above. Your journal entries remain completely private and encrypted.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h5 mt-4">4.5 Legal Requirements</h3>
            <p>We may disclose your information if required by law:</p>
