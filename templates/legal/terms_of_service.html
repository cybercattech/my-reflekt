            <h3 class="h5 mt-4">5.2 License to Us</h3>

                <li>Violates intellectual property rights</li>

            </ul>

            <h3 class="h5 mt-4">5.4 POV (Point of View) Sharing Feature</h3>
            <p>Reflekt allows you to share specific portions of your journal entries with friends using POV blocks. By using this feature, you acknowledge and agree to the following:</p>

            <p><strong>Your Responsibilities as a Sharer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent</strong> - You have the right to share the content you're posting in POV blocks</li>
                <li><strong>Irrevocability</strong> - Once a POV is shared, it becomes part of your friend's journal entry. While you can delete the POV from your side, you cannot force removal from the recipient's journal</li>
                <li><strong>Friend Verification</strong> - POVs can only be shared with confirmed friends on the platform</li>
                <li><strong>No Sensitive Information</strong> - You should not share others' personal information, trade secrets, or confidential information without permission</li>
                <li><strong>Appropriate Content</strong> - Shared POVs must comply with our Acceptable Use policy (Section 6)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Your Rights as a Recipient:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deletion Right</strong> - You can delete any POV shared with you from your journal at any time</li>
                <li><strong>Reply Option</strong> - You can choose to reply to POVs or ignore them</li>
                <li><strong>No Obligation</strong> - You're not required to read, respond to, or keep shared POVs</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting</strong> - If a POV contains inappropriate content, you can report it to us</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Data Handling:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shared POV content is encrypted at rest, just like your regular journal entries</li>
                <li>POV content is only visible to you (the author), the specified recipients, and Reflekt for AI processing</li>
                <li>When you delete your account, all POVs you authored are deleted from tracking, but content already in friends' journals may remain</li>
                <li>When a friend deletes their account, POVs they shared with you may remain in your journal unless you delete them</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="alert alert-warning small mb-4">
                <strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> Think carefully before sharing POVs. Once shared, the content is in someone else's journal. While they can delete it, you cannot control what they do with it. Only share what you're comfortable with your friends keeping permanently.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">6. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>You agree NOT to:</p>
